This component is responsible for provisioning [AWS Network Firewall](https://aws.amazon.com/network-firewal) resources,
including Network Firewall, firewall policy, rule groups, and logging configuration.

## Usage

**Stack Level**: Regional

Example of a Network Firewall with stateful 5-tuple rules:

> [!TIP]
>
> The "5-tuple" means the five items (columns) that each rule (row, or tuple) in a firewall policy uses to define
> whether to block or allow traffic: source and destination IP, source and destination port, and protocol.
>
> Refer to
> [Standard stateful rule groups in AWS Network Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/stateful-rule-groups-basic.html)
> for more details.

Example of a Network Firewall with [Suricata](https://suricata.readthedocs.io/en/suricata-6.0.0/rules/) rules:

> [!TIP]
>
> For [Suricata](https://suricata.io/) rule group type, you provide match and action settings in a string, in a Suricata
> compatible specification. The specification fully defines what the stateful rules engine looks for in a traffic flow
> and the action to take on the packets in a flow that matches the inspection criteria.
>
> Refer to
> [Suricata compatible rule strings in AWS Network Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/stateful-rule-groups-suricata.html)

| <a name="input_attributes"></a> [attributes](#input\_attributes) | ID element. Additional attributes (e.g. `workers` or `cluster`) to add to `id`,<br>in the order they appear in the list. New attributes are appended to the<br>end of the list. The elements of the list are joined by the `delimiter`<br>and treated as a single ID element. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| <a name="input_context"></a> [context](#input\_context) | Single object for setting entire context at once.<br>See description of individual variables for details.<br>Leave string and numeric variables as `null` to use default value.<br>Individual variable settings (non-null) override settings in context object,<br>except for attributes, tags, and additional\_tag\_map, which are merged. | `any` | <pre>{<br>  "additional_tag_map": {},<br>  "attributes": [],<br>  "delimiter": null,<br>  "descriptor_formats": {},<br>  "enabled": true,<br>  "environment": null,<br>  "id_length_limit": null,<br>  "label_key_case": null,<br>  "label_order": [],<br>  "label_value_case": null,<br>  "labels_as_tags": [<br>    "unset"<br>  ],<br>  "name": null,<br>  "namespace": null,<br>  "regex_replace_chars": null,<br>  "stage": null,<br>  "tags": {},<br>  "tenant": null<br>}</pre> | no |

| <a name="input_delimiter"></a> [delimiter](#input\_delimiter) | Delimiter to be used between ID elements.<br>Defaults to `-` (hyphen). Set to `""` to use no delimiter at all. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_descriptor_formats"></a> [descriptor\_formats](#input\_descriptor\_formats) | Describe additional descriptors to be output in the `descriptors` output map.<br>Map of maps. Keys are names of descriptors. Values are maps of the form<br>`{<br>   format = string<br>   labels = list(string)<br>}`<br>(Type is `any` so the map values can later be enhanced to provide additional options.)<br>`format` is a Terraform format string to be passed to the `format()` function.<br>`labels` is a list of labels, in order, to pass to `format()` function.<br>Label values will be normalized before being passed to `format()` so they will be<br>identical to how they appear in `id`.<br>Default is `{}` (`descriptors` output will be empty). | `any` | `{}` | no |
| <a name="input_enabled"></a> [enabled](#input\_enabled) | Set to false to prevent the module from creating any resources | `bool` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_environment"></a> [environment](#input\_environment) | ID element. Usually used for region e.g. 'uw2', 'us-west-2', OR role 'prod', 'staging', 'dev', 'UAT' | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_firewall_policy_change_protection"></a> [firewall\_policy\_change\_protection](#input\_firewall\_policy\_change\_protection) | A boolean flag indicating whether it is possible to change the associated firewall policy | `bool` | `false` | no |

| <a name="input_label_key_case"></a> [label\_key\_case](#input\_label\_key\_case) | Controls the letter case of the `tags` keys (label names) for tags generated by this module.<br>Does not affect keys of tags passed in via the `tags` input.<br>Possible values: `lower`, `title`, `upper`.<br>Default value: `title`. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_label_order"></a> [label\_order](#input\_label\_order) | The order in which the labels (ID elements) appear in the `id`.<br>Defaults to ["namespace", "environment", "stage", "name", "attributes"].<br>You can omit any of the 6 labels ("tenant" is the 6th), but at least one must be present. | `list(string)` | `null` | no |
